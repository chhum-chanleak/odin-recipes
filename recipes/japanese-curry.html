    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes. The curry roux, from no heat to very spicy, can be bought at any international grocery store. It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. This recipe is very flexible; it can easily be made for more or less people. It can also be frozen (don't put the potatoes in).

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
